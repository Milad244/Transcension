## Description
Transcension is a 2D game I developed myself. Trapped inside your mind, you must traverse a treacherous path, overcome various traps, and defeat the guard of your prison. For the first time, I recorded my entire journey of creating this game on YouTube in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLesP53Zl6Cp2Jux0-xHTzYutJgp_b2mdj).
